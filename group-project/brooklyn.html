   <div class="summary1"> <h3>Welcome to Brooklyn</h3>

   <p>Brooklyn is the most populated Borough in New York City and the second-largest in land area among the boroughs of New York City. Yea, it's pretty big. Brooklyn is my favorite borough because of its blend of people, its beauty (natural and manmande), and it has something for everyone. Before I get into the fun stuff let me give you a little background on Brooklyn.</p>
    
    <p>The borough has gone through many changes from being inhabited by the Lenape people, to Dutch settlers arriving and naming it Breukelen. Which means "broken land" in Dutch. From then on Brooklyn has become home to many other ethnic groups who have settled in Brooklyn and contributed to its diverse cultural make up.</p>
    
    <p>Brooklyn was also its own city up until the year 1898 when it, along with others, was incorporated into New York City, a decision famously known as "The Great Mistake of 1898." Even with losing its independence, the spirit and pride that the people of Brooklyn have for their borough is undeniable.</p>
    
    <p> It is no secret that Brooklyn has risen to become one of NYC's top borough. So make Brooklyn a destination on your visit to NYC.</p>
